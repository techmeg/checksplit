# Split the Check

This is a WIP app for splitting a restaurant check among friends. There are options for splitting the check evenly, taking the bar tab away from the designated driver and apportioning a smaller bill segment to kids.

TODO: refactor logic (not DRY at all yet) and move to PWA for phone use, as not too many people lug their desktops to restaurant meals.
